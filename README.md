# Sophomore Hub

Sophomore Hub is a Web Application which is created to bring the Alumni and the current students together. I have kept it as Sophomore as the Sophomore sounds catchy as compared to Freshers and Final year Grads XD. The Application is created so that the current students can connect with themselves share Project Ideas, stay up to date with college events, if someone is working on a project and want some more like minded pople to join he can find them there. Also, the platform connects Alumni with the current students For example If an Alumni is looking for interns, hiring associates for his project, if some one is establishing startup and is looking for partners, so they can use this platform. The main thing is these students look for opportunities in outer world, recruiters look for different colleges but if they do within the network itsm the most trusted deal they get out of here!
